## 1. Introduction 
<p align="justify"> 
  Today, web applications bring businesses and customers together quickly, and Laravel simplifies how they are built by using MVC, Eloquent ORM, and Blade templating. Because of these features, websites can be made secure and organized in less time.

  We are creating BiteBarakah, a halal-certified dessert shop on the web using Laravel. Clients will be able to view and purchase Shariah-compliant desserts, while the admin panel makes it easy to oversee all orders and the virtual shop. Because Laravel includes CRUD operations, authentication, and routing features, the userâ€™s experience on your e-commerce site is both halal and smooth.

  We have chosen Laravel since it provides a neat MVC design, methods for easy database management, and support for dynamic front-end creation using Blade. Participating in this project will teach you how to build a web store with a user-friendly interface that follows Islamic principles. People will be able to access a safe, user-friendly, and attractive website that meets halal standards.
